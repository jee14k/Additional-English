                 My Own House			        Sipi Pallipuram

The black cat, White dog, brown rabbit and the blue sparrow were friends. They played different types of games from morning to evening. The black cat sometimes gave the toy car to the white dog to play sometimes. The white dog used to give the ball to the brown rabbit sometimes. The brown rabbit used to bring special seeds from the forest for the blue sparrow to fly and play with. The blue sparrow used to stretch out branches for the cat to swing and play. Like this, everyday – they used to play these games. 
After many days – they got bored of the old games. They were thinking hard to think of new games. One day – the black cat came running to his friends and said, “Friends, I have found a new game to play – fun game.” “What game is it?”, his friends asked. “We shall exchange houses”, the cat explained. “Bow – bow, change the house? How do we do that?”, said the dog. “Flip – flop, change the house? How do we do that?”, wondered the brown rabbit. “Kee – kee, change the house? How do we do that?”, asked the blue sparrow. The black cat said, “I will stay in the blue sparrow’s house – make the nest ready for me.” The blue sparrow asked, “Then what will I do?”
